## Things that I learned...
1. The better use of position property of CSS, and how powerful it is if combined with other properties like z-index and transform.
2. Better understanding of the GSAP library and what CSS affects its behavior
3. SVG handling

## The problems I faced while creating this...
1. The biggest problem was adjusting the video section, adding appropriate paddings and margin so that the video covers the whole screen (100vh, 100vw) while the upper portion is not cut out.
2. Adjusting the SVGs, as I wanted to make it as close to the original as possible.

## Things that I wanted to add but couldn't...
The same problem with Broadwick Live clone that I made, I dunno how to do smooth scroll with GSAP, and if I use any other known way (like using CSS or any external packages), then the whole CSS breaks down. If anyone has any solution regarding this, please tell me.


### Otherwise, nothing much actually. This was more of a designing challenge than a developing one. And since this is a clone, so I didn't have to do much designing. \ Anyway I learned something new, that's enough for me...
